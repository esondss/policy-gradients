PG's learning is smoother than Q-learning, but update can only be may by the end of an episode. We compare two REINFORCE's, one ues z-score as bias and the other one uses state-value V(s). The figure below shows the total rewards from 50 iterations, each iteration has 10 episodes. With parameters being the same, their results are very similar.
